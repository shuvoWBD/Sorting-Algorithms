# Sorting-Algorithms
A sorting algorithm is a method used to arrange data or numbers in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. It helps make data processing and searching faster and more efficient. Sorting is very important in programming because many tasks require organized data. Different sorting algorithms have different speeds and efficiencies depending on the size and condition of the data.
