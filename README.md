# Sorting-Algorithms
A sorting algorithm is a method used to arrange data or numbers in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. It helps make data processing and searching faster and more efficient. Sorting is very important in programming because many tasks require organized data. Different sorting algorithms have different speeds and efficiencies depending on the size and condition of the data.



**Insertion Sort**

  * It builds the sorted list one element at a time.

  * It is simple and easy to understand and implement.

  * It works efficiently for small or nearly sorted datasets.

  * It is a stable sorting algorithm.

  * Its average and worst-case time complexity is O(n2).

  * It requires very little extra memory.


**Merge Sort**

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the list into smaller parts, sorting those parts, and then merging them back together in the correct order. It is efficient and works well even for large datasets.

* It follows the divide-and-conquer approach.

* It divides the array into two halves repeatedly.

* It merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted list.

* It has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in all cases.

* It is a stable sorting algorithm.

* It requires extra memory for merging.
